ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 Unfortunately, Git doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option for what keys to use, you have to configure this in the ~/.ssh/config file:
# Personal account Host github.com HostName ssh.github.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github User git # Company account Host gitcompany Hostname ssh.github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_company Host private.git.server.com PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key_file_for_this Starting from git version 2.</description></item><item><title>Manage dotfiles with GNU Stow</title><link>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/gnu-stow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/gnu-stow/</guid><description>I use GNU stow to manage all the important dotfiles.
Instructions Create a repo called dotfiles in your $HOME directory Recreate the directory structure for the files you want to manage as subdir(s) of that directory. mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles/bash mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_logout ~/.dotfiles/bash cd ~/.dotfiles stow bash Stow will create symlink for each file.
.bashrc -&amp;gt; dotfiles/bash/.bashrc Don¬¥t forget to add this file to your git repo. Commit and push to remote and your done.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a python developer by trade, so let&amp;rsquo;s say hello in python!
