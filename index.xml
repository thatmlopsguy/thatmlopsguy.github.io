# Personal account Host github.com HostName ssh.github.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github User git # Company account Host gitcompany Hostname ssh.github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_company Host private.git.server.com PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key_file_for_this Starting from git version 2.</description></item><item><title>Manage dotfiles with GNU Stow</title><link>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/gnu-stow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/posts/gnu-stow/</guid><description>I use GNU stow to manage all the important dotfiles.
