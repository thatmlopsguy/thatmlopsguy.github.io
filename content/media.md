I usually avoid to watch all the trendy TV series on Neflix (and similar platforms), because of 
[Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)](http://defectivebydesign.org/).

I do not wont to be influenced by all the fuss of mass marketing and evaluate the TV show for what it is.

Here's all of the TV and movies I've watched and recommend.
