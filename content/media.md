I usually avoid to watch all the trendy TV series on Neflix (and similar platforms), because of 
[Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)](http://defectivebydesign.org/). For technical users I recommend
to read the following paper [Your DRM Can Watch You Too: Exploring the Privacy Implications of Browsers (mis)Implementations of Widevine EME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05416).

I do not wont to be influenced by all the fuss of mass marketing and evaluate the TV show for what it is.

Here's all of the TV and movies I've watched and recommend.
