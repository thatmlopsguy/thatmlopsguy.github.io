# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

This is my Hello page, a concept [popularized by Alastar Johnson](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/).

You can find out a bit more on the [about page](about.md). My [now page](now.md) lists what Iâ€™m focused on currently.

Here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:

- My favourite way to converse is email ðŸ“§. See [contact](contact.md) page.
- For a quick chat you can talk add me on Signal. Again see [contact](contact.md) page.
- My least favorite means of communication is via phone call.
- I donâ€™t use any Meta products: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Threads.
- I donâ€™t use Twitter (nor what it has morphed into) or LinkedIn.

And that is it for me. Iâ€™m always looking for new people to connect with, learn from and collaborate with, so get in touch
without hesitation.
