# 🤝 Let's work together

I have been working professionally as a data scientist and machine learning engineer since 2016, working
across a wide range of technologies, platforms, and teams. I found my passion in properly delivering
code and creating a stable and capable infrastructure for it.
I wanted to expose myself to a wider variety of projects and became a {Dev,ML}Ops and cloud consultant.
Over the years, I’ve specialized in backend development, infrastructure, and open-source systems.

I'm a cloud engineer specializing in container orchestration and multi-cloud architecture, currently based
in Portugal. My expertise centers around Kubernetes implementation and optimization, complemented by
extensive experience with both Azure and AWS platforms. In the last years, I’ve also taken on technical
leadership roles: helping teams ship clean, scalable systems while mentoring developers and aligning
architecture with business goals.

Most of my coding experience is with Python, simply because it was the language I used at my first job.
I started with flask, but then I discovered FastAPI which quickly became my favorite framework.
I have a wide variety of experience with different machine learning frameworks and databases, though I
am very open to learning new technologies.

I can work well in a team setting, in a leadership role, or as a solo developer. I have a strong background
in backend development, software architecture, DevOps, site reliability engineering, and
platform engineering.

During my career, I had opportunities to build both monoliths and microservices, work with relational and
non-relational databases, use various message brokers, build REST and gRPC APIs, build distributed systems,
and more. I have participated in all stages of the software development process, from designing architecture
to implementing and deploying the solution.

I wrote a lot of documentation including ADRs, API specs (using OpenAPI), and RFCs.
I have experience with various testing frameworks and tools, like pytest and CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems.
If I do something more than three times, I automate it. Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are
things I do first, not when the time allows it later. I communicate well, I learn quickly, and I always strive
for excellence in my work. I prefer remote work.

I hold a [MSc in Astronomy & Astrophysics from the University of Porto (UP)](https://www.fc.up.pt/studyresearch/study-at-fcup/graduate_courses/astronomy-and-astrophysics/), with my dissertation being developed at the
_[Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IA)](https://www.iastro.pt/index.html)_.

## 📋 Experience highlights

- Built and maintained production Kubernetes clusters with autoscaling and multi‑environment promotion
- Migrated manual deployments to GitOps, reducing change failure rate and lead time for changes
- Reduced AWS and Azure costs by improving capacity planning
