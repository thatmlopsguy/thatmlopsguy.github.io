## Let's work together

I have been working professionally as a data scientist, machine learning engineer and devops since 2016.
Currently I am a cloud engineer working from Portugal üáµüáπ.

Most of my coding experience is with Python, simply because it was the language I used at my first job.
I started with flask, but then I discovered FastAPI which quickly became my favorite framework.
I have a wide variety of experience with different machine learning frameworks and databases, though I
am very open to learning new technologies.
I can work well in a team setting, in a leadership role, or as a solo developer.

During my career, I had opportunities to build both monoliths and microservices, work with relational and
non-relational databases, use various message brokers, build REST and gRPC APIs, build distributed systems,
and more. I have participated in all stages of the software development process, from designing architecture
to implementing and deploying the solution.

I wrote a lot of documentation including ADRs, API specs (using OpenAPI), and RFCs.
I have experience with various testing frameworks and tools, like pytest and CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems.
If I do something more than three times, I automate it. Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are
things I do first, not when the time allows it later.

I communicate well, I learn quickly, and I always strive for excellence in my work. I prefer remote work.

## üïü My Working Hours

You'll almost definitely be able to find me online between the following hours (Europe/London timezone):

| Day       | Hours          |
|-----------|----------------|
| Monday    | 09:00 - 18:00  |
| Tuesday   | 09:00 - 18:00  |
| Wednesday | 09:00 - 18:00  |
| Thursday  | 09:00 - 18:00  |
| Friday    | 09:00 - 18:00  |

Outside of those hours, I may be online as I may be working more flexibly.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Structure of my working day

I prefer having a standup between 0930-1030, so I have a bit of time before it to check messages and see whether
things have progressed overnight, as well as checking that there hasn't been anything going wrong in production
that needs looking into.

I prefer to have lunch at a fixed time each day, usually at 1200-1300, but like the ability to be flexible.
