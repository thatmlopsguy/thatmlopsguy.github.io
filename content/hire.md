# ü§ù Let's work together

I have been working professionally as a data scientist, machine learning engineer and devops since 2016.
Currently I am a cloud engineer working from Portugal üáµüáπ.

Most of my coding experience is with üêç Python, simply because it was the language I used at my first job.
I started with flask, but then I discovered FastAPI which quickly became my favorite framework.
I have a wide variety of experience with different machine learning frameworks and databases, though I
am very open to learning new technologies.

I can work well in a team setting, in a leadership role, or as a solo developer. I have a strong background
in backend development, software architecture, DevOps, site reliability engineering, and
platform engineering.

During my career, I had opportunities to build both monoliths and microservices, work with relational and
non-relational databases, use various message brokers, build REST and gRPC APIs, build distributed systems,
and more. I have participated in all stages of the software development process, from designing architecture
to implementing and deploying the solution.

I wrote a lot of documentation including ADRs, API specs (using OpenAPI), and RFCs.
I have experience with various testing frameworks and tools, like pytest and CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems.
If I do something more than three times, I automate it. Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are
things I do first, not when the time allows it later. I communicate well, I learn quickly, and I always strive
for excellence in my work. I prefer remote work.

I hold a [MSc in Astronomy & Astrophysics from the University of Porto (UP)](https://www.fc.up.pt/studyresearch/study-at-fcup/graduate_courses/astronomy-and-astrophysics/), Portugal.
