I'm a python developer by trade, so let's say hello in python!

```python
print("Hello World")
```

This blog will be my little space of the internet where I can share what I feel I want to.

I'll mostly write about tech stuff, but I won't shut the door to any other subjects.

Any feedback is highly appreciated!

This concludes my first post of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).
