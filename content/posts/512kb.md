As I sit down to write this, I find myself reflecting on the journey that led me to join [512KB.Club](https://512kb.club/),
a community that stands at the intersection of the [Small Web Movement](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/)
and my personal quest for simplicity and efficiency in web design. This isn't just another blog post; it's a deeply personal exploration of
how embracing constraints can lead to creativity and innovation.

My fascination with the Small Web Movement began with a simple observation: the web is becoming too cluttered,
too slow, and too inaccessible for many users. [Websites are bloating in size, consuming resources, and failing
to deliver a seamless experience across devices and networks](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm).
This isn't just a problem for tech enthusiasts; it is a barrier to access and engagement for millions of people worldwide.

One day, while browsing the web, I stumbled upon 512KB.Club. The idea of limiting website sizes to 512 kilobytes seemed
radical yet intriguing. It challenged the status quo and offered a glimpse into a future where web design prioritizes
performance and accessibility over sheer size and complexity.

Cloudflare has a tool called radar which analyses the site and returns a bunch of analytics along with the size of your site.
Here is my [scan](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/7cc9e1ed-1692-4451-9c1e-dd416131b3d7/summary), **165.9kB** of data.

I opened up a [pull request](https://github.com/kevquirk/512kb.club/pull/1553) and now I am listed on 512kb.club.

As I continue my journey with 512KB.Club, I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. One of my [next objectives](next.md) is
to be listed on the [250kb.club](https://250kb.club/).

There are also more small clubs. I listed them in my [links](links.md) webpage.

**UPDATE (2024/07/20):** I [joined](https://github.com/nkoehring/250kb-club/issues/436) the [250kb.club](https://250kb.club/) ðŸŽ‰.
