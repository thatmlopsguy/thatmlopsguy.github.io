# ü™ß Colophon

A colophon is a statement at the end of a book, typically with a printer‚Äôs emblem, giving information about its authorship and printing.

Hence the name of this page that explains how this blog is built.

This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
The theme I‚Äôm using is based on [Cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) and
I [tweaked it](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/hugo-theme-cactus2).

The site and the respective code for the build files are [hosted on github](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/thatmlopsguy.github.io).

I use VS Codium to write the code and posts for the site. No large language models were used in any of the writing on this website.

This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect or are based on work, opinions or policies
of any of my (previous) employers. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.

## üîí Privacy Policy

I designed this website with the privacy of readers in mind. I don't want to collect any information
that I do not need to serve pages on this website.

Here is the thing: there are quite a few companies out there that live off acquiring and selling your data.
That would be kind of ok if it was more transparent how this is done. But of course, only those who are not
interested in your data are the ones who properly communicate what they do. This is the case here.

## üìÆ Comments

I don't like comments section on personal webpages or blogs and even if they works as expected,
creates another maintenance burden for the owner.
So, no comments section but you can always [contact me](contact.md) to share your thoughts.
