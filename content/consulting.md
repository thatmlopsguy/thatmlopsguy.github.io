# ðŸ“Š Consulting

I help companies make the most of their technology by supporting them in machine learning projects.

## What can I do for you?

I'm a devops engineer with 8+ years of experience working with both scientific institutions and multinational
companies. I help companies fix their software architecture, improve their tools and processes, and run
on-site workshops.

Here are some things I can do for your company:

- **Workshops**: Are you looking for a bespoke workshop on a machine learing/cloud native related topic?
    A 1-day-long workshop on testing or deployment can save you days of trial and error.

- **Software Architecture**: Are you looking for a project setup that balances simplicity and scalability?
    Do you feel overwhelmed by the multitude of available tools and frameworks? Perhaps your current project
    has become too complex, and you need to refocus your efforts?
    I understand the challenges of building robust yet accessible projects. My expertise can help you create
    a solution that's easy to start with but powerful enough to support thousands of users. I will guide your
    company through the process of choosing the right tools and frameworks for your specific needs, ensuring
    your project remains manageable and scalable as it grows.

- **Project Management**:  I can lead a small ML team or join the Project Management Team for a
    larger-scale AI initiative.
