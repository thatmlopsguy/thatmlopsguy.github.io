# ðŸ“Š Consulting

I help companies make the most of their technology by supporting them in machine learning projects.

Is your business using AI but are feeling stuck? Many companies often feel overwhelmed navigating
the sea of options and trade-offs when rolling out AI and often just want to know if theyâ€™re doing
it right.

## What can I do for you?

I'm a devops and machine learning engineer with 8+ years of experience working with both scientific
institutions and multinational companies. I help companies fix their software architecture, improve
their tools and processes, and run on-site workshops.

Here are some things I can do for your company:

- **Workshops**: Are you looking for a bespoke workshop on a machine learning/cloud native related topic?
    A 1-day-long workshop on testing or deployment can save you days of trial and error.

- **Software Architecture**: Are you looking for a project setup that balances simplicity and scalability?
    Do you feel overwhelmed by the multitude of available tools and frameworks? Perhaps your current project
    has become too complex, and you need to refocus your efforts?
    I understand the challenges of building robust yet accessible projects. My expertise can help you create
    a solution that's easy to start with but powerful enough to support thousands of users. I will guide your
    company through the process of choosing the right tools and frameworks for your specific needs, ensuring
    your project remains manageable and scalable as it grows.

- **Project Management**:  I can lead a small ML team or join the Project Management Team for a
    larger-scale AI initiative.
