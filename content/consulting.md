# 📊 Consulting

I help companies make the most of their technology by supporting them in machine learning projects.

Is your business using AI but are feeling stuck? Many companies often feel overwhelmed navigating
the sea of options and trade-offs when rolling out AI and often just want to know if they’re doing
it right.

## What can I do for you?

I'm a devops and machine learning engineer with 8+ years of experience working with both scientific
institutions and multinational companies. I help companies fix their software architecture, improve
their tools and processes, and run on-site workshops.

Here are some things I can do for your company:

- **Conducting Technical Interviews**: Hiring your first software developer presents both challenges
    and opportunities. It's crucial to make this hire effectively, especially if you lack the technical
    expertise to evaluate candidates yourself. I can assist with crafting job descriptions and conducting
    interviews to ensure your initial technical hire meets expectations and sets the stage for building
    a strong team.

- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploying new features or updating applications traditionally results in
    downtime and manual, error-prone processes. Many programmers fear deployment due to its tedious nature
    and potential for human mistakes. I can help set up automated deployment pipelines that remove manual
    steps and significantly reduce errors caused by human intervention.  

- **Mentoring Workshops**: Your development team lacks experience in devops? Are you looking for a bespoke workshop
    on a machine learning/cloud native related topic? I can help explaining in a 1-day-long workshop
    various concepts, best practices, and tools that can help you and your development team, saving you
    days of trial and error.

- **Software Architecture**: Are you looking for a project setup that balances simplicity and scalability?
    Do you feel overwhelmed by the multitude of available tools and frameworks? Perhaps your current project
    has become too complex, and you need to refocus your efforts?
    I understand the challenges of building robust yet accessible projects. My expertise can help you create
    a solution that's easy to start with but powerful enough to support thousands of users. I will guide your
    company through the process of choosing the right tools and frameworks for your specific needs, ensuring
    your project remains manageable and scalable as it grows.

- **Project Management**:  I can lead a small ML team or join the Project Management Team for a
    larger-scale AI initiative. I can assist you in validating your ideas, determining their feasibility with
    current technology, identifying potential development challenges, and recommending the appropriate
    development team for your project.
