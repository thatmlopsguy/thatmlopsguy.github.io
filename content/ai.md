# ðŸ¤– AI usage

While reading Derek Siversâ€™ [site](https://sive.rs/) I found his [`/ai`](https://sive.rs/ai) page and decided to create my own.

I use [phind.com](https://www.phind.com/) mostly for research, similar to search engines.

If this changes in the future, Iâ€™ll update this page at this permanent URL: [`thatmlopsguy.github.io/ai`](https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/ai).
