This page serves as record for my online identity. It is inspired by [Molly White's verify page](https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/).

I control the following personal accounts:

- Github: [thatmlopsguy](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy)
- Signal: [profile id](https://signal.me/#eu/tioeXhSUgbUbo7L62t5Xd3BZ9FyW--TLsacCsSNPv2biYX2gnmpMApPYBrzGnYLi)

If there’s an account claiming to be me and it’s not one of these accounts on the list, it’s probably an impersonator.
