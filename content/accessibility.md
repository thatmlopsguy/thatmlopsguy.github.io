# 🐕‍🦺 Accessibility

Making this website accessible to all.

I aim to meet a minimum of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)
2.2 Level AA.

You should be able to:

- use your browser defaults for settings, sizes and styling
- zoom in (or out) without breaking your experience
- navigate the site with just your keyboard
- listen to the site using a screen reader

If you have come across something you find inaccessible, please [contact me](contact.md).
