# üéôÔ∏è Interviews FAQs

Interesting or habitual questions I've been asked during job interviews.

This page is also inspired by [Manual of Me](https://my.manualof.me/), and aims to be a guide for colleagues in
how to best work with me.

## ü§ù Introduction questions

### Why should I hire you? What makes you different from other candidates?

Computers engineering has been my vocation since I was 16 years old, and since then I've been involved
with computers in a lot of aspects. I love anything that can be an intellectual challenge to me.

My experience has provided me a lot knowledge in almost all computers engineering areas, so I can be able to
understand the implications of each decision at several levels (extra costs, delays,  performance issues, user
experience, possible bottlenecks...), and clearly explain the systems tradeoffs and business implications that
are derived for each one of them. That also has lead myself to put high attention on code quality and to develop
simple and minimal APIs in all the code I develop, and to enforce that high quality standards on others.

### What do your think about code tests? Do you do take-home code assignments?

**Yes, but no leetcode**. I have no problems about doing technical/system design interviews.

### Where are you located?

See my [where](where.md) webpage.

If your question is related to adjust your salary offer to life level costs, you
can target your offer to the region of London, Great Britain.

### Are you available to relocate?

I'm interested on 100% remote positions. I can consider hybrid job positions depending of the following:

- company will pay meal diets for all the days I would need to be presencial
- company will pay both arrive and leave train tickets (also if it's in a daily or weekly basis),
  and accommodation for all the time I would need to be presencial.

If it's not possible to meet these requirements, I'm able to work 100% on remote and travel as frequently as required,
as far as company pays train tickets, diets and hotel room.

### Are you interested in learning new technologies? Which ones and why?

At this moment I'm learning about Machine Learning, where I'm more interested in Natural Language Programming
and Large Language Models, and I'm improving my skills with golang programming language.

I'm a hands-on learner, so if I get some interesting project between my hands or find something that I think can be
fixed or improved, I don't have problems learning new skills or knowledge that can be useful to me to do it,
specially if they are established and future-proof technologies and not just some temporally fashioned
or hyped libraries and frameworks.

### What are the three things you think are the most important to improve a software project?

1. Write specs and document the behavior that should have the project, and keep
   it updated while it's being implemented with its actual one
2. Register and trace all the errors, so they can be replicated later
3. Fully automate all processes, remove the human factor always that's possible

## üè¢ Company culture

### How do you expect your boss should be?

The most important things, it has a technical background, so it can understand when I explain what
problems does we have or why something can't be done.

The second one, it's managing the company because really love what it's doing and believe in the company itself,
also when it's in losses. It must not take decisions just only based on economics, no matter the consequences.

### What type of company would you like to work for and why?

I like to work for mid size companies that has its own product, that's mostly focused on the quality of
their product over any other aspect, instead of being directed by sales department or any predefined deadlines.

### Do you prefer to work alone, or as part of a group?

I like to work in a small group, specially focused on a single project where there's a clear roadmap
on what to do, or where technical expertise of co-workers is high and everybody is trying to do their best.
This open the door to the possibility of discuss the different approaches to the problems and learn ones
from the others.

In the same way, I like to be surrounded by co-workers with good technical skills so I can take in account
their points of view too when defining the project architecture, the development guidelines or the project
quality that others have to follow.

I particularly enjoy working with teams to improve their processes and tools, engaging in high-level architecture
planning, or diving into short, sharply focused improvements that need to be made.

In other cases where that's not possible, I usually like to work as part of a group where people can be
focused each one on an area of the code that they can master and know in detail and manage it on their own,
so everybody can be able to focus on their knowledge area.

### What do you value the most about a team?

- Team lead is somebody I can learn from, or somebody humble that know its limits and when it's better
  to trust in the experts knowledge, also when they are lower on the company hierarchy.
- Team members are motivated, distressed, and working together for the same goal.
- Everybody is focused trying to achieve technical excellence, and doing their best instead of doing it fast.
- Co-workers are technically as good as me or better, so I can be able to learn from them, or they have
  initiative and are eager to learn and improve themselves.

## üë® Personal questions

### Do you currently have a job? What do you like and dislike about it?

Currently I'm working as *Cloud Engineer* as my main job.

#### üëç Likes

- remote work
- lots of schedule flexibility
- over average payment
- interesting new technologies

#### üëé Dislikes

- legacy code and design decisions, and almost no time to fix them
- complex architectures with lots of inter-dependencies between projects

### What would motivate you to change job/join a new project?

1. The most important, an interesting project that caught my attention and motivates me to do the change
   by itself, no matter any other things like salary, relocation or social benefits. This can be the project
   topic or technologies being used.
2. A salary according to my expectations.
3. Quantity and quality of social benefits provided in addition to the salary, specially meal card, remote
   work, flexible schedule.
4. Innovation, design of new technologies, and usage and development of open and standard specifications.
5. Management based on async communications, with clear specifications, roadmap and requirements. This does not
   exclude of having face-to-face meetings, but based on my experience, usually a hands-on meeting every quarter
   is more than enough.

### What you are looking for in your next job?

A project I can feel my own and get involved on it, helping to define its shape.
Also a project that can make me proud of and help to learn new things and improve my career.

### If I made you an offer, what would make you to reject it?

If we get up to this point, probably I would have already consider the pros & cons regarding changing my
current job, so only I would reject a job offer if the tasks I would be involved are not motivational
enough, or the final salary difference with my current job would not compensate the change, so it's better
that we discuss these topics in the first interview to don't waste everybody time.

###  What are my working Hours

You'll almost definitely be able to find me online between the following hours (Europe/London timezone):

| Day       | Hours         |
|-----------|---------------|
| Monday    | 09:00 - 18:00 |
| Tuesday   | 09:00 - 18:00 |
| Wednesday | 09:00 - 18:00 |
| Thursday  | 09:00 - 18:00 |
| Friday    | 09:00 - 18:00 |

Outside of those hours, I may be online as I may be working more flexibly.

### Structure of my working day

I prefer having a standup between 0930-1030, so I have a bit of time before it to check messages and see whether
things have progressed overnight, as well as checking that there hasn't been anything going wrong in production
that needs looking into.

I prefer to have lunch at a fixed time each day, usually at 1200-1300, but like the ability to be flexible

### Bring your own device (BYOD) policy

For a matter of fact I don't use any of my personal devices for working, this includes my cellphone.

While Microsoft Authenticator is a popular choice for 2FA, there are several alternatives available for those
who prefer not to use it. Given my strong emphasis on protecting personal information and maintaining confidentiality,
I neither have nor wish to create accounts with Google or Apple to obtain the Microsoft Authenticator app.
Furthermore, [Microsoft Authenticator transmits analytics even before users accept the privacy terms](https://defcon.social/@mysk/109995712305528246),
raising concerns about data collection and potential misuse of user information.

One option is to utilize a dedicated physical security key, such as the YubiKey, which provides enhanced
security by generating codes offline and not relying on a potentially compromised smartphone.
Otherwise, the company will need to buy me a dedicated phone with a sim card.
