## Newsboards

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) - My favorite news outlet. Tech, programming, Entrepreneurship and other important news.
- [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) - Very similar to Hacker News, but strictly focused on software development.
- [freepo.st](https://freepo.st/) - Similar to Hacker News and lobsters but only related with free software and free culture.
