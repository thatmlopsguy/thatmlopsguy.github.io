# ðŸ’µ Salary History

When looking for a job, it can be tricky to know what to ask for in terms of salary, especially for under
represented minorities, who are routinely underlevelled and underpaid. So after reading
[Jamie Tannaâ€™s post](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/09/09/public-salary-history/) on providing a public salary history
I thought it would be useful to share my salary history, in hopes that people are better informed about how much
money they can make, so that they can be paid equally for equal work.

It might be worth checking out my [resume](hire.md) to see what skills and work were required in my roles.
