# ðŸ‘Ž Nope

Things I don't want like, inspired by [Nope's Jack Baty](https://baty.net/nope/).

For companies I don't like, visit my [boycott](boycott.md) webpage.

Here is a list of things I don't like, in no particular order. I'll update it as needed.

- **SmartTVs**: this devices are [full of trackers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03447) and spy on you via [ACR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06203)
- send "anonymous" usage/telemetry data
- tracking consent
- cookie banners
- subscribe to receive updates/no available RSS or Atom feed
- nonsensical password requirements
- the form requires a phone number
- passkeys
- ask to install a proprietary app for MFA
- [SMS-based two-factor authentication](https://www.issms2fasecure.com/)
