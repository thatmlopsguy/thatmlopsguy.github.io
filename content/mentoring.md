# 💪🏻 Mentoring

You're seeking mentoring. Do you need personalised one-on-one guidance as an early or mid-career
professional?

Over the years, I have had the privilege of guiding many aspiring software engineers, helping them
achieve their career goals, improve their skills, and navigate the challenges of their roles.

## What can you expect from this program?

My mentorship methodology is meticulously designed to cover a broad spectrum of developmental facets,
ensuring a holistic approach to your growth and success.

- **Customized Mentorship Programs**: Tailored to fit your unique aspirations and requirements,
    these programs can enhance your coding abilities, introduce you to emerging tech, or equip you
    for job interviews. Each plan is crafted to match your individual needs.

- **In-depth Code Analysis**: Benefit from comprehensive critiques of your code, fostering adherence
    to top-tier standards, enhancing code integrity, and facilitating the development of resilient
    applications.

- **Professional Development Support**: Aligning with your professional ambitions, we refine your CV,
    hone interview techniques, and strategize for overcoming workplace hurdles.

- **Interactive Knowledge Sharing**: Engage in frequent dialogues on software engineering subjects,
    keeping abreast of sectoral evolutions and enriching your expertise within the discipline.

My goal is to build a bond, where we have a weekly meeting of about an hour, over the course of multiple
weeks or even months. I’m also available for one-off meetings where I answer one specific question one time.

## What do I expect from you?

You’re going to need a good enough internet connection to talk and share your screen. You need to be able
to speak English or Portuguese. You’re going to need at least a basic understanding of computer science,
I can’t teach you that from scratch.

Finally, as my preferred “office hours” are between Saturday 10:00 and 12:00 Central European Time (Paris),
our schedules have to match as well.
