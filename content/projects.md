# 👨‍💻 Projects

I’ve worked on a bunch of different things over the years. This is a small list of projects I have done during the last years.

The code for most, if not all of them, can be found on my [github](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy) account.

- [this website](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/thatmlopsguy.github.io): goal of this project was to market my services,
but I also wanted to get out of my backend comfort zone and learn a bit more about modern frontend things

- [github-repo-operator-ansible](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/github-repo-operator-ansible): kubernetes operator for managing gitHub repositories (ansible)

- [asdf-argocd-image-updater](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/asdf-argocd-image-updater): argocd-image-updater plugin for
the asdf version manager

- [cookiecutter-ml-project](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/cookiecutter-ml-project): blueprints for python based ML projects

🚧 Work in progress! 🚧
