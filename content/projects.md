# ‚úçÔ∏è Projects

This is a small list of data analysis and other related projects I have done during the last years.
The code for most, if not all of them, can be found on my [github](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy) account.

- [this website](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/thatmlopsguy.github.io): goal of this project was to market my services,
but I also wanted to get out of my backend comfort zone and learn a bit more about modern frontend things.

- [asdf-argocd-image-updater](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/asdf-argocd-image-updater): argocd-image-updater plugin for
the asdf version manager.

- [cookiecutter-ml-project](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/cookiecutter-ml-project): blueprints for python based ML projects.
