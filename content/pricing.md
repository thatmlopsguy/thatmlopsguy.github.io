# 💰 Pricing

While reading Paul's [weblog](https://paul.af/) I found his [`/pricing`](https://paul.af/pricing) page and decided to create my own.

| Services              | Price                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------|
| Workshops             | €600 for one day hands-on experience with GitOps using ArgoCD |
| Software Architecture | €740 per day                                                  |
| Project Management    | €740 per day                                                  |

For a description of each service check out the [consulting page](consulting.md).

I'm open to other pricing structures, including retainer arrangements, discounts might be possible, transitioning to a more
permanent role might be possible.

Let's [have a conversation](contact.md).
