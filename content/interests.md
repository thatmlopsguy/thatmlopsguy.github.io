# 🧩 Interests

This is an interests page, inspired by [Chris Burnell’s post](https://chrisburnell.com/note/slash-interests/).

As you might be able to tell from my [identities](verify.md), I’m not present in any social media platform.
Instead, I prefer to read blog posts. It serves a similar purposes to me. I really prefer to follow blogs where:

- The typical post is longer than a social media post, my preference is a 5-8 minute read.
- There aren’t consistently multiple posts per day. I don’t want my RSS reader to be overwhelmed.

A great consequence of this is that there’s a finite number of posts for me to check out per day.
Unfortunately, there seems to be a natural tendency over time for people to stop creating new posts.
This means I am always on the hunt for new interesting blogs to follow.

Every so often, I get asked for recommendations on which blogs to follow. To get around this, I’ve created
the [postroll](postroll.md). This is a partial list of blog posts that I’ve enjoyed recently.
My hope is that if you find their posts interesting too, that you would give them a follow!

These are some of my main areas of interest (does not include job related topics):

- Free and Open Web/Privacy/Free Software
- Earth System Dynamics
- Physics/Astrophysics
- Economy/Geopolitics
- Philosophy/Epistemology

Do we have something in common?

Please, [contact me](contact.md)! There's much we can discuss.

Check out the [/interest pages directory](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/) for more of these.
