# ðŸ§© Interests

This is an interests page, inspired by [Chris Burnellâ€™s post](https://chrisburnell.com/note/slash-interests/).

These are some of my main areas of interest (does not include job related topics):

- Free and Open Web
- Privacy
- Free software
- Earth System Dynamics
- Physics/Astrophysics
- Economy
- Geopolitics
- Philosophy/Epistemology

Do We Have Something In Common?

Please, [contact me](contact.md)! There's much we can discuss.

Check out the [/interest pages directory](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/) for more of these.
