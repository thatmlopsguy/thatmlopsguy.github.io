I reveal that if an average human being was placed on a rowing machine (or exercise bike, or treadmillâ€¦) for
a year of 250 eight-hour shifts, the total amount of energy that the person could expend into the machine
would be 500 megajoules.

How much is 500 megajoules? It is roughly equivalent to the energy stored within 14 litres of gasoline (petrol).

I remember wathing this concept in the the TV episode [Bang Goes the Theory: The Human Powered Power](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p8469).
