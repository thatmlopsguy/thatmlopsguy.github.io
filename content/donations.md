# 💸 Donations

I’m in no need for money, and I release my code and projects for free (as in freedom) because I want to contribute
back to the environment that helped me succeed. If you really are inclined to support my projects, please consider
donating to the [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/) or [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).
