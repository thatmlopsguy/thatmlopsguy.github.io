Hello there! I'm a random tech guy shouting into the void on the internet.

This is the place where I share my thoughts and notes about things that
I‚Äôm excited about and working on and hope to connect with people having
a similar mindset. I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

## üëã About Me

I'm a [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) user, a big advocate for the [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/)
and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movements.

I have worked for 3+ years as Data Scientist, eventually finding my true calling in DevOps and MLOps.
Currently I am a cloud engineer working from Portugal üáµüáπ. Most of my coding experience is with
Python, simply because it was the language I used at my first job. I started with flask, but then
I discovered FastAPI which quickly became my favorite framework.

During my career, I had opportunities to build both monoliths and microservices, work with relational and
non-relational databases, use various message brokers, build REST and gRPC APIs, build distributed systems,
and more. I have participated in all stages of the software development process, from designing architecture
to implementing and deploying the solution. 

I wrote a lot of documentation including ADRs, API specs (using OpenAPI), and RFCs. 
I have experience with various testing frameworks and tools, like pytest and CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

On this page you can find some information about me and a few blog posts I wrote. Most of them are about
topics that I'm most interested in, such as containers, security, CI/CD, or about programming languages like Python.

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects 
I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Contact

As a privacy advocate, I try to use the best contact options. People should be able to talk, via the internet, 
with the same level of privacy as a face-to-face conversation in their own home.

Before you contact me, please take note of the following:

- I don‚Äôt accept guest posts. Sorry, this is a personal blog.
- Don‚Äôt contact me regarding advertising on the blog.
- I don't have time to provide tech support.
- Please be polite; I‚Äôll always be polite to you.

I usually respond promptly, but please don‚Äôt take it personally if there is a slight delay.

Signal is my messaging app of choice. It's a fantastic tool that I've been using for years.
It uses the [gold standard of encryption](https://www.signal.org/docs/), 
conceals [metadata well](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/), has a
[great track record](https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/),
is recommended by countless experts in the field and more.
Now that [Signal supports usernames](https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/), 
you can contact me without having to share phone numbers.

## ‚úç Projects

### Blog & Personal Website

This website. Goal of this project was to market my services, but I also wanted to get out of my backend 
comfort zone and learn a bit more about modern frontend things.

üöß Work in progress! üöß

### Blueprints for python based ML projects

I‚Äôm in no need for money, and I release my code and projects for free (as in freedom) because I want to contribute 
back to the environment that helped me succeed. If you really are inclined to support my projects, please consider
donating to the FSF or EFF.
