Hello there! I'm a random tech guy shouting into the void on the internet.

This is the place where I share my thoughts and notes about things that
I’m excited about and working on and hope to connect with people having
a similar mindset. I’d love to hear from you!

## 👋 About Me

I'm a [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) user, a big advocate for the [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/)
and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movements. I like trying to understand the world, building things
that improve it, and talking about it on the web.

On this page you can find some information about me and a few blog posts I wrote. Most of them are about
topics that I'm most interested in, such as containers, security, CI/CD, or about programming languages like Python.

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects 
I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.

See [What Am I Doing Now?](https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/now/) and [What Do I Use?](https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/uses)

If you are interested in hire me, check this [page](hire.md).

## ✍ Projects

### Blog & Personal Website

This website. Goal of this project was to market my services, but I also wanted to get out of my backend 
comfort zone and learn a bit more about modern frontend things.

🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

### Blueprints for python based ML projects

I’m in no need for money, and I release my code and projects for free (as in freedom) because I want to contribute 
back to the environment that helped me succeed. If you really are inclined to support my projects, please consider
donating to the FSF or EFF.
