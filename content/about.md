# 👋 About Me

I’m ██████████ █████, a ██ years old working on ████████ at ███████████.

On a more serious note, I enjoy computer science, privacy and pretty much everything related.
I'm a [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) user, a big advocate for the [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/)
and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movements. I like trying to understand the world, building things
that improve it, and talking about it on the web. Check my [interests](interests.md) page.

On this page you can find some information about me and a few blog posts I wrote. Most of them are about
topics that I'm most interested in, such as containers, security, CI/CD, or about programming languages like Python.

I use this site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects
I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.

I avidly read technical blogs across various subjects. I enjoy engaging in discussions on platforms like Hacker News
and exploring the vibrant community of Indie Hackers. I’ve been immersed in open source since the early days of my
career, shortly after I started using GNU/Linux. I believe it’s one of the best models for building quality software.
I'm an active contributor to free and open source software (FOSS) and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing,
as evidenced by my blog posts and [github profile](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy).
You can track my projects [here](projects.md) and my contributions [here](contributions.md).

I offer specialized AI engineering services focusing on production-ready applications.
Check out my [services](consulting.md) page to learn how I can help bring your project to life.
If you want my full resume including all (previous) jobs, experience and education, or you are interested in hire me,
check [this page](hire.md).

Spending the majority of my days sitting in front of a computer screen; I’m always happy when I take the time to go
on a walk and admire nature’s natural beauty.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something useful or interesting.
