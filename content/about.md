## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) user, a big advocate for the [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/)
and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movements. I like trying to understand the world, building things
that improve it, and talking about it on the web.

On this page you can find some information about me and a few blog posts I wrote. Most of them are about
topics that I'm most interested in, such as containers, security, CI/CD, or about programming languages like Python.

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects
I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.

I'm an active contributor to free and open source software (FOSS) and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing,
as evidenced by my blog posts and [github profile](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy).

See [What Am I Doing Now?](now.md) and [What Do I Use?](uses.md)
