# 🤝 Contributions

Previously I was keeping track of these manually in a text file.

I figure these having a more public home isn’t a bad thing.

- tika helm chart [feat: add topologySpreadConstraints support in deployment](https://github.com/apache/tika-helm/pull/24)
- asdf-plugins [add argocd-image-updater plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins/pull/1026)
