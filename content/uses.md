Inspired of [many pages out there](https://uses.tech/), I've put together this page that covers some parts of my setup.

## Development

- IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I also use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/emacs) for the excellent [org-mode]().
- Terminal emulator: [URxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
- shell: zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Terminal multiplexer: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

I also use various terminal utilities and CLI tools that I use for scripting and just general 
shell surfing. Some of them that I want to give a shout-out to, in rapid fire:

- exa
- fd
- fzf
- htop
- httpstat
- moreutils
- ncdu
- ripgrep

Check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/dotfiles).

## Miscellaneous

- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/): keyboard-driven and tiling window manager
- Firefox: I have a privacy-hardened setup with a custom `user.js` and with the following extensions: [ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
- [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) Messenger App using [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli)
- [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) where I follow news sites, blogs and indie sites I love, 
certain Youtube channels, and changelogs for software I keep track of. I mostly read from the terminal with `w3m`.
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/): my video player of choice. Keyboard-driven, minimal UI. Also works with `yt-dlp` to stream youtube videos.
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/): password manager.
