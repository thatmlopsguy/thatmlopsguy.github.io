Inspired of [many pages out there](https://uses.tech/), I've put together this page that covers some parts of my setup.

## Development

- IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- shell: zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Terminal multiplexer: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

Check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/dotfiles).

## Miscellaneous

- Firefox (Extensions: [ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock))
- [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) Messenger App
