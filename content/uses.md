Inspired by [many pages out there](https://uses.tech/), I've put together this page detailing some of the important tools
I use for those that may be interested.

## ðŸ’» Development

My personal operating system of choice is Arch Linux because itâ€™s very easy to work with, simple, and incredibly up-to-date.
Iâ€™ve used it since somewhere around 2015.

- Operating System: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- Window Manager: [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
- IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I also use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/emacs) for the excellent [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/).
- Terminal emulator: [URxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
- shell: zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Terminal multiplexer: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- File Manager: thunar, [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

I also use various [terminal utilities and CLI tools](https://terminaltrove.com/)
that I use for scripting and just general shell surfing.
Some of them that I want to give a shout-out to, in rapid fire:

- exa
- fd
- fzf
- htop
- httpstat
- moreutils
- ncdu
- ripgrep

## ðŸŽ² Miscellaneous

- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/): keyboard-driven and tiling window manager.
- [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox): I have a privacy-hardened setup with a custom `user.js` and
with the following extensions:
  - [ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
  - [libredirect](https://github.com/libredirect/browser_extension)
  - [videospeed](https://github.com/codebicycle/videospeed)
  - [treestyletab](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab)
- [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) Messenger App using [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).
- [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) where I follow news sites, blogs and indie sites I love,
certain Youtube channels, and changelogs for software I keep track of. I mostly read from the terminal with `w3m`.
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/): my video player of choice. Keyboard-driven, minimal UI. Also works with `yt-dlp` to stream youtube videos.
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/): password manager with [pass otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp) extension.
- [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku): bookmark manager.

## ðŸ’³ Services

- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/): a privacy-focused, set it and forget it DNS service. I use their security features on my home network
and a profile with strict ad-blocking rules on all of my devices.
- [Proton](https://proton.me/): a reliable, trustworthy email, VPN provider with all of the features you'd expect from such a service.
