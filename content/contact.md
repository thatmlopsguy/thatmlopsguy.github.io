# ‚òéÔ∏è Contact

As a privacy advocate, I try to use the best contact options. People should be able to talk, via the internet, 
with the same level of privacy as a face-to-face conversation in their own home.

Before you contact me, please take note of the following:

- I don‚Äôt accept guest posts. Sorry, this is a personal blog.
- Don‚Äôt contact me regarding advertising on the blog.
- I don't have time to provide tech support.
- Please be polite; I‚Äôll always be polite to you.

I usually respond promptly, but please don‚Äôt take it personally if there is a slight delay.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Email

You can email me below:

```sh
printf "%s@%s.%s\n" tsilva pm me
```

Please send me encrypted mails if possible. [Every bit of encrypted traffic increases the encrypted background noise 
and thus makes it harder to distinguish between important and unimportant traffic](https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm).
If you need help, visit [Email Self-Defense](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/) guide by the FSF.

```sh
$ curl -sf https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/public.asc | gpg --import
```

```sh
$ gpg --list-keys 
Key fingerprint = 04EF B891 FCB4 475C F00F  C665 74A6 1A5A 8EFF EC72
```

If you‚Äôre concerned about email metadata, feel free to send me a [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) message instead (see below).

## üí¨ Instant Messaging

Signal is my messaging app of choice. It's a fantastic tool that I've been using for years.
It uses the [gold standard of encryption](https://www.signal.org/docs/), 
conceals [metadata well](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/), has a
[great track record](https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/),
is recommended by countless experts in the field and more.
Now that [Signal supports usernames](https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/), 
you can contact me without having to share phone numbers. 
[Message me on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/tioeXhSUgbUbo7L62t5Xd3BZ9FyW--TLsacCsSNPv2biYX2gnmpMApPYBrzGnYLi).

## üåç Elsewhere

Nothing else except those, I don‚Äôt have a Facebook, a LinkedIn, a Discord, an ExpertSEXchange, a MySpace, a Twitter, 
a Twatter, a Swatter, a Fatter, a Squatter, a Platter or whatever is the latest fad nowadays. 
If somebody claims to be me, chances are it‚Äôs not actually me.

I don‚Äôt use social media and neither software nor hardware by Google, Microsoft (with the exception of Github),
~~Facebook~~ Meta (Instagram, Whatsapp, Threads), or Apple for ethical reasons.
