# ☎️ Contact

I’m happy that you’re thinking about reaching out! If you’re at a loss of words to say, feel free to engage
me on my [interests](interests.md).

People should be able to talk, via the internet, with the same level of privacy as a face-to-face
conversation in their own home. Before you contact me, please take note of the following:

- I don’t accept guest posts. Sorry, this is a personal blog.
- Don’t contact me regarding advertising on the blog.
- I don't have time to provide tech support.
- Please be polite; I’ll always be polite to you.

I usually respond promptly, but please don’t take it personally if there is a slight delay. Also note that I follow
[VSRE](http://vsre.info/) and [Crocker’s rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html). In other words, you don’t need to
“break the ice” (but feel free to do so anyway!) and you can go directly to the purpose of your message.

## ✉️ Email

The best way to get a hold of me is through email. You can email me below:

```sh
printf "%s@%s.%s\n" tsilva pm me
```

I advocate the use of [Plain-text emails](https://useplaintext.email/).

🚨 Please send me encrypted mails if possible. [Every bit of encrypted traffic increases the encrypted background noise
and thus makes it harder to distinguish between important and unimportant traffic](https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm).
If you need help, visit [Email Self-Defense](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/) guide by the FSF and follow
the [OpenPGP best practices](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices).

To import my pgp public key 🔑 you can use the following command:

```sh
$ curl -sf https://thatmlopsguy.github.io/public.asc | gpg --import
```

My current fingerprint is:

```sh
$ gpg --list-keys
Key fingerprint = 04EF B891 FCB4 475C F00F  C665 74A6 1A5A 8EFF EC72
```

If you’re concerned about email metadata, feel free to send me a [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) message instead (see below).

## 💬 Instant Messaging

Signal is my messaging app of choice. It's a fantastic tool that I've been using for years.
It uses the [gold standard of encryption](https://www.signal.org/docs/),
conceals [metadata well](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/), has a
[great track record](https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/),
is recommended by countless experts in the field and more.
Now that [Signal supports usernames](https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/),
you can contact me without having to share phone numbers. Click [**here to message me on Signal**](https://signal.me/#eu/tioeXhSUgbUbo7L62t5Xd3BZ9FyW--TLsacCsSNPv2biYX2gnmpMApPYBrzGnYLi) or scan this QR code with the Signal App.

## 🌍 Elsewhere

Nothing else except those. I'm not on any social networks, not on Facebook, not on LinkedIn, not on
Twitter, IRC, Mastodon, etc. If somebody claims to be me, chances are it’s not actually me. Visit my [verify](verify.md)
webpage for more info.
