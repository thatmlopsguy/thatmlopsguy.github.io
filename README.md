# That MLOps Guy Blog

This is the repository for my personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static site generator written in Go.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (for local development)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (alternative for local development)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/thatmlopsguy.github.io.git
cd thatmlopsguy.github.io
```

If you've already cloned the repository without submodules, initialize them:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Option 1: Using Hugo (Recommended)

1. Install Hugo on your system following the [official installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   hugo serve
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313`

### Option 2: Using Docker

1. Set the Hugo version (optional, defaults to latest):

   ```bash
   export HUGO_VERSION=0.119.0
   ```

2. Start the development server using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   make docs-serve
   # or
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313`
